For this assignment, I used an AI assistant to support the writing and organization of my answers. The AI was used in the following ways:
To clarify the requirements of each task and help outline the main sections of the report (Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3).
To generate initial drafts of the explanations about key-value databases (e.g., Redis), document databases (e.g., MongoDB), caching strategies, and historical logging, based on my descriptions of the homework prompt.
