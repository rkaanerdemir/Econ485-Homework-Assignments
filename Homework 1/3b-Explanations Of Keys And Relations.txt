
Explanations of keys and relations


StudentID, CourseID, InstructorID, SectionID, and RegistrationID are chosen as primary keys because they are unique identifiers and do not change over time.​

CourseID is used as a foreign key in SECTION so that each section is always linked to exactly one course.​

InstructorID is a foreign key in SECTION so the system always knows who is teaching each section.​

StudentID and SectionID are foreign keys in REGISTRATION to connect students and sections and to model the many‑to‑many relationship between them.​

The many‑to‑many relation between STUDENT and SECTION is solved by the REGISTRATION table, which breaks it into two 1‑N relations.​

All non‑key fields in each table depend on the whole primary key, not part of it, so there are no partial dependencies and the design satisfies 2NF.
