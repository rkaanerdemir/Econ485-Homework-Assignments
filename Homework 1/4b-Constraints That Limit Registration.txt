
Limiting rules are important because they prevent impossible or unfair schedules, like two classes at the same time or too many credits in one semester.​
Time‑conflict rules help students avoid overlapping sections and make sure they can attend all meetings.
Credit‑load rules (minimum, standard, maximum) protect students from taking too many or too few courses at once.
Mutually exclusive courses stop students from earning credit twice for almost the same content.
To enforce these rules, the system needs extra tables and fields, such as a SCHEDULE table (SectionID, DayOfWeek, StartTime, EndTime, Room).
For maximum credits, the system needs to store credits per course and maybe MaxCredits and MinCredits per program or per student.
For mutually exclusive courses, it may need a MUTUAL_EXCLUSION table with CourseID and ExcludedCourseID.
Before allowing registration, the system must check the student’s existing sections, total credits, past failures, withdrawals, and mutually exclusive pairs.
These checks and tables are not included in the basic system from Part 2, because that system ignores time conflicts, credit limits, and exclusion rules to stay simple.
