Constraints like prerequisites and co‑requisites are important because they make sure students have the right background before taking harder courses.

They protect academic quality and help students follow the correct order of courses, such as Calculus I before Calculus II.​

To support prerequisites, the system needs a PREREQUISITE table, for example: CourseID, PrerequisiteCourseID, MinimumGrade.​

For co‑requisites, the system might need a COREQUISITE table that links two courses that must be taken in the same semester.

For required repeat chains and failed courses, the system may need fields like IsRequired and IsCore in COURSE, and a grade field in REGISTRATION or a separate ENROLLMENT table.

The system must store which course depends on which other course, and what minimum grade is accepted, so it can automatically block or allow registrations.

These tables and fields are not needed in the simple system from Part 2, because that system has no rules about order, no prerequisite checks, and no repeat logic.

The simple system only cares about creating students, courses, sections, and registrations, so it does not need to store constraint information.
